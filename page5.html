        <p class="secondary-text">"Today, we are doing something that should have been done a long time ago. For years, politicians in Washington let our enemies steal our future. They let China control the magnets in our fighter jets. They let Russia control the fuel for our nuclear reactors. It’s a disgrace. But today, that ends.
<br><br>
I am signing a historic order invoking the Defense Production Act. We are telling the Pentagon: if it’s not American, we don’t want it. We are going to buy American minerals, American processing, and American strength.
<br><br>
We are unlocking the vast treasures of our own land. To the miners in California separating the rare earths—we are with you. To the millers in Utah processing the uranium and heavy metals—get ready, because we are going to buy everything you can produce. To the copper miners in the Southwest—we need you for our grid and our AI.
<br><br>
We are fast-tracking permits. No more waiting ten years to open a mine. If you are digging for the materials that keep America safe—whether it’s antimony for our ammo or silver for our high-tech electronics—you are now a priority national security asset. We are bringing the supply chain home, and it’s going to be beautiful."</p>
